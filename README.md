# Traffic Data Analysis

This repository contains a Python-based analysis of traffic data, focusing on understanding traffic patterns and variations.

## Project Description

This project analyzes a traffic dataset (`traffic.csv`) to extract meaningful insights. The analysis includes:

* Loading and inspecting the data using Pandas.
* Analyzing the distribution of the `Traffic Situation` and converting it to a numerical representation.
* Visualizing traffic patterns, including the distribution of traffic situations and average vehicle counts over time.

## Files

* `traffic.csv`: The dataset used for this analysis. It includes traffic information such as time, date, day of the week, vehicle counts (car, bike, bus, truck), total vehicles, and traffic situation.
* `Assignment3.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the analysis.

## Libraries Used

The project uses the following Python libraries:

* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Plotly

## Setup

To run the analysis in the `Assignment3.ipynb` notebook, you need to install the required libraries.  You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly
